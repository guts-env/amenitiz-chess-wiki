### The following are the arbitrary compromises I made to meet the requirements:

- There are no tests, I only tested the app manually
- Only basic error handling (catches errors and shows a message in the console)
- No retry logic for failed requests
- No aria-labels and other accessibility features, I did not want to spend time on it
- No error boundary component
- Only a simple loading state
